# CS 665 Project 1:
## Database management application for an arcade.
- Consists of four tables: Players, Games, Plays, and Employees
- The GUI provides features allowing the user to perform CRUD operations on each table.
- The GUI also has a feature for finding high scores, which is an operation requiring a join.

Nearly all code was created using Copilot / Claude 3.5 then slightly modified to better fit the project requirements.
